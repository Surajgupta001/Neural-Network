    "## Array Summation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In NumPy, `np.sum` is the standard way to sum elements of an array. It works on scalars, 1D vectors, and higher-dimensional arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "A = np.array([[1, 2, 3],\n",
    "              [4, 5, 6],\n",
    "              [7, 8, 9]])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sum all elements\n",
    "np.sum(A)                  # 45 (same as np.sum(A, axis=None))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sum column-wise (axis=0)\n",
    "np.sum(A, axis=0)          # array([12, 15, 18])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sum row-wise (axis=1)\n",
    "np.sum(A, axis=1)          # array([ 6, 15, 24])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For a 2D array with shape `(rows, columns)`:\n",
    "- `axis=0` collapses rows and keeps one value per column.\n",
    "- `axis=1` collapses columns and keeps one value per row.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extra knowledge:**\n",
    "- `np.sum` is vectorized and much faster than Python's built-in `sum` on large numeric arrays.\n",
    "- For higher-dimensional tensors in deep learning, `axis` controls whether you reduce over the batch dimension, feature dimension, time steps, etc.\n",
    "- You can also pass a tuple of axes, e.g. `np.sum(A3d, axis=(1, 2))` to sum over multiple dimensions at once."

    "### Use of `keepdims`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `keepdims` parameter in many NumPy reduction functions (such as `np.sum`, `np.max`, `np.mean`) is used to **keep the reduced axes with size 1** instead of removing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "A = np.array([[1, 2, 3],\n",
    "              [4, 5, 6],\n",
    "              [7, 8, 9]])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Without keepdims (default)\n",
    "col_sum = np.sum(A, axis=0)            # shape: (3,)\n",
    "row_sum = np.sum(A, axis=1)            # shape: (3,)\n",
    "\n",
    "# With keepdims=True\n",
    "col_sum_kd = np.sum(A, axis=0, keepdims=True)  # shape: (1, 3)\n",
    "row_sum_kd = np.sum(A, axis=1, keepdims=True)  # shape: (3, 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Shapes:\n",
    "- `A.shape` is `(3, 3)`.\n",
    "- `col_sum.shape` is `(3,)`, but `col_sum_kd.shape` is `(1, 3)`.\n",
    "- `row_sum.shape` is `(3,)`, but `row_sum_kd.shape` is `(3, 1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is `keepdims` useful?**\n",
    "- It preserves dimensions so that results can **broadcast back** against the original array.\n",
    "- This is very common in deep learning when normalizing over an axis (e.g., subtracting a per-row mean or max) while keeping shapes compatible for broadcasting."

    "## Broadcasting Rules in NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadcasting is a powerful mechanism in NumPy that allows operations to be performed on arrays of different shapes **without** explicitly copying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadcasting rules:\n",
    "1. If the arrays do not have the same number of dimensions, the shape of the smaller array is padded with ones on its **left** side until both shapes have the same number of dimensions.\n",
    "2. For each dimension, the sizes must be either **equal** or **one**. If they differ and neither is 1, NumPy raises an error.\n",
    "3. The result shape is the element-wise maximum of the input shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "vector = np.array([1, 2, 3])          # shape: (3,)\n",
    "matrix = np.array([[4, 5, 6],\n",
    "                   [7, 8, 9]])       # shape: (2, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "result = matrix + vector             # shape: (2, 3)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[ 5  7  9]\n",
    " [ 8 10 12]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `vector` (shape `(3,)`) is treated as `(1, 3)` and then broadcast to `(2, 3)` to match `matrix`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extra knowledge:**\n",
    "- You can use `np.newaxis` (or `None`) to insert size-1 dimensions and control broadcasting, e.g. `vector[:, np.newaxis]` gives shape `(3, 1)`.\n",
    "- Many neural network operations rely on broadcasting to apply biases (`(1, features)`) across a whole batch (`(batch_size, features)`).\n",
    "- A common error is: `ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together` — check the shapes and see which dimension pair violates the rules above."
